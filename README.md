# responsive-div-table

*Script was implemented for a fully accessible web page with div tag tables which is AODA friendly* 

swipe.js makes a table responsive with the idea of swiping a set of columns to right or left in a smaller view. Swipe touch motions inputs are accepted in mobile/touch devices.

Best to work with tables for comparison.
